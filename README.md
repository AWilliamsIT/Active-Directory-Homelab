# Active-Directory-Homelab

Description

In this Homelab I deployed and configured two virtual machines using VirtualBox.
One of the machines was a Microsoft Server 2019 instance, which I used to run Active Directory.
To create a domain, I configured a Domain Controller and set up a domain, allowing me to manage users and groups with ease.
With this infrastructure in place, I wrote a PowerShell script to create over 1000 users in Active Directory.
